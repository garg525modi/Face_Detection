## Face Detection using OpenCV
The basics of face detection using Haar Feature-based Cascade Classifiers.

We will extend the same for eye detection & smile Detection in homework_solution.py.

OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile etc.

First we need to load the required XML classifiers. Then load our input image (or video) in grayscale mode
